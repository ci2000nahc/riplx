# Overview

Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that leverages the XRP Ledger's (XRPL) core features to solve a real-world problem. We are seeking innovative solutions with a variety of use-cases.

# Areas of Interest

If you don't know where to start, we are especially interested in applications around:

- Payments
- Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization
- RLUSD integration
- Decentralized identity (DID)

# Successful Project Criteria

A successful project will solve a real-world financial problem using XRPL. Features could include:

- DID-integrated fintech identity flows
- RLUSD-based apps
- SDKs for other developers to easily integrate XRPL features like RLUSD, escrows, and DIDs into their app
- Payment apps, microfinance, and Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization

# Submission Requirement (IMPORTANT)

To compete, you must submit a working, testable MVP that is publicly available on GitHub with a detailed README. Show us how you can use the XRPL to innovate in DeFi.
